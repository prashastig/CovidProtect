			<p style="text-align: center;">
				<p>Handwashing remains one of the best ways to prevent the spread of</p>
				<p>(COVID-19). It’s common sense and it works. However, it</p>
				<p> must be done properly and with soap and water. When soap and
					<p>water arenot available, the next best option is to use an alcohol-based hand
						sanitizer</p>
				</p>
				<h3 class="index4">
					Maintain a safe distance from anyone who is coughing or sneezing.
				</h3>
				<div><img src="pictures/download.jfif" alt=""></div>
				<p>
					<p>At least 1 metre distance between yourself and anyone who is</p>
					<p>coughing or sneezing. When someone coughs or sneezes, they </p>
					<p>spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus.</p>
				</p>
				<h3 class="index5">
					Wear a mask when physical distancing is not possible.
				</h3>
				<div><img src="pictures/mask.jfif" alt=""></div>
				<p>
					<p>Wear masks in areas where social distancing is not possible, </p>
					<p>the World Health Organization has advised in its updated guidelines, issued Friday, on the use of
						masks.</p>
				</p>
				<h3 class="index6">Don’t touch your eyes, nose or mouth.</h3>
				<div><img src="pictures/eyes.png" alt=""></div>
				<p>
					<p>
						To help prevent infections, keep your hands away from your eyes, nose, and mouth especially
						during the COVID-19 pandemic.
					</p>
				</p>
				<h3 class="index7">Stay home if you feel unwell.</h3>
				<div><img src="pictures/stay.jfif" alt=""></div>
				<p>Stay Home and Call a Health Care Provider. Unless it is an emergency, to reduce your risk of </p>
				<p>catching or spreading illness, stay home if you feel sick, even if </p>
				<p>your symptoms are mild. Do not go to work, school or public places, and avoid public transportation.
				</p>
				<h3 class="index8">
					If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical
					attention.
				</h3>
				<div><img src="pictures/ill.png" alt=""></div>
				<p>
					<p>Know when to seek medical care. Otherwise, if you have a fever </p>
					<p>and cough or other cold or flu symptoms, but are otherwise healthy, </p>
					<p>are under age 60, aren't having difficulty breathing, and don't feel </p>
					<p>seriously ill, you're better off caring for yourself at home.</p>
				</p>
				<h3 class="index9">
					Cover your nose and mouth with your bent elbow or a tissue when you
					cough or sneeze.
				</h3>
				<div><img src="pictures/sneeze.jfif" alt=""></div>
				<p>
					<p>Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze. </p>
					<p>Throw used tissues in the trash. If you don't have a tissue, cough or sneeze into your elbow, not
						your hands.</p>
